### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation guide

1. Clone this repository ([learn how to do it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).

- Your project ID and token from [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io).
- Your client ID and client endpoint from [Commerce Layer](https://core.commercelayer.io/users/sign_up).

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

npm install
```

4. Add your project `name`, `projectId,` and `dataset` in `./template-values-dev.json`.

5. Build template files into the `./build` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build both `web` and `studio` files.

### ‚ú® Run frontend locally

1. Install the necessary dependencies for Nextjs.

```bash
cd build/web && npm install
```

2. Start the development server in `./build/web`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the frontend at `localhost:3000`

### üóÇ Run studio locally

1. Install the necessary dependencies for Sanity Studio.

```bash
cd build/studio && sanity install
```

2. Start the development server in `./build/studio`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the studio at `localhost:3333`

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Import test studio content

1. Extract the `production.tar.gz` file in `./data` directory using the command below.

```bash
tar -xf production.tar.gz
```

The extracted folder name should look like `production-export-2021-02-26t14-15-56-557z`.

2. Run the command below in the extracted folder to import a `data.ndjson` file.

```bash
sanity dataset import data.ndjson production
```

NB: If your dataset is not named `production`, kindly update the dataset name to the right value.
