```

4. Add your project `name`, `projectId,` and `dataset` in `./template-values-dev.json`.

5. Build template files into the `./build` directory.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Import test studio content

1. Extract the `production.tar.gz` file in `./data` directory using the command below.

```bash
tar -xf production.tar.gz
```

The extracted folder name should look like `production-export-2021-02-26t14-15-56-557z`.

2. Run the command below in `./build/studio` to import the `data.ndjson` file in the extracted folder.

```bash
sanity dataset import ../../data/<name of extracted folder>/data.ndjson production
```

NB: If your dataset is not named `production`, kindly update the dataset name to the right value.
